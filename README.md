## Templates

The `template/` directory contains templates for use in creating new
repositories, including:

- a `.coveralls.yml` file with common settings.
- a `.gitattributes` file with common settings.
- a `.gitignore` file with common exclusions.
- a `.travis.yml` template with recommended configuration for new components.
- a `CHANGELOG.md` template with library changelog.
- a `composer.json` with a basic package structure.
- a `LICENSE.md` template.
- a `mkdocs.yml` file with MkDocs configuration.
- a `phpcs.xml` file with zend coding standard configuration.
- a `phpunit.xml.distÂ§ file with PHPUnit configuration.
- a `README.md` template for new components with basic structure.
- a `docs/` directory with support templates:
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with the Code Manifesto.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions on how to contribute.
  - `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for new issues.
  - `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for new pull requests.
  - `SUPPORT.md` with instructions on how to get support for the package.
- a `docs/book/` directory with documentation template.
- a `src/` directory with `ConfigProvider` template.
- a `test/` directory with `ConfigProviderTest` test case.

Templates all use the same placeholders, which can be replaced en masse:

- `{year}` is the year of first publication, or a range of years from first
  publication until most recent update.
- `{org}` refers to the github organization under which the package will live.
- `{repo}` is the name of the repository.
- `{category}` should be one of `expressive`, `components`, or `apigility`.
- `{namespace}` should be the top-most namespace unique to the repository.
- `{namespace-test}` should be the namespace used for unit tests in the repository.

## Maintainer tools

CLI tools for automating several tasks, particularly the LTS workflows, are present in this
repository. Run the following:

```console
$ composer install
```

to ensure dependencies are present. The tools are in the `bin/maintainers.php` script.

### `bin/zf-maintainer`

This script currently has the following actions:
- `changelog-bump <version> [-b|--base <master|develop>]` - bumps the
  CHANGELOG version for the current component;
- `create-package <name>` - creates a new package from templates;
- `lts:components` - lists LTS components, one per line;
- `lts:patch` - rewrites a component patch so it may be applied against the ZF2 repo;
- `lts:release` - tags a new LTS maintenance release of all components;
- `rebase-doc-template <path>` - rebases all templates for specified package.

To get more information about each command you can call them with `--help` flag.
